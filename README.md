# Roll The Dice

___

## Description

I initially designed this project on [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/). The reason of designing the project on [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/) was to visualize how everything would appear in the browser and determine which colors worked well for the project. I then selected the font family and text colors for my project. Finally, as I began coding the project, I employed HTML5 semantic tags to enhance the project's informativeness and adaptability. This approach allows browsers and search engines to better understand the content. I also utilized advanced CSS3 selectors, classes, and properties to style the project, incorporating CSS3 gradient colors and animations as a backdrop for my game.

The most challenging aspect of coding this game was devising the game's logic and figuring out how to roll the dice while synchronizing the dice's dots that appeared after each roll with the current score. Additionally, I needed to update the current score displayed in the respective div. Initially, when I clicked the button, it didn't yield any results due to a discrepancy between the dice image's name and the value generated by the Math.random() function. I resolved this issue by ensuring that the dice image's name matched the value from the Math.random() function.

For the game's functionality, I implemented three click event listeners and associated them with three buttons. The first button is used to roll the dice, the second one to save the current score and switch control to player 2, and the third to reset the game or start a new one. I utilized variables to store the current score and track the active player's status. JavaScript Arrays were used to store the total scores of both players, allowing for later comparison with the winning score upon score-saving. Finally, I incorporated the JavaScript Confetti library to display confetti upon winning the game.

## How to Play

When the game begins, Player 1 takes the initial turn. Player 1 faces two options: rolling the dice or saving the current score. If Player 1 opts to roll the dice, they can repeatedly roll until a single dot (1) appears or until they decide to save their current score. Choosing to save the current score results in the turn shifting to Player 2. In case either player rolls the dice and obtains a single dot (1), the active player forfeits their current score, and the turn transfers to the opposing player.

To secure victory, the first player must attain the winning score.
